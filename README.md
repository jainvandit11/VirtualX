# Virtual-X-with-Augmented-Reality-

<h4>Virtual-X  is an Augmented Reality learning app which teaches about Planets , human body , mechanical parts and also about the botony. It</h4>

<h3> Problem Statement</h3>

Traditional education can be boring, passive, and one-size-fits-all. This can lead to disengagement and poor learning outcomes.Also Poor infrastructure also leads to less than ideal quality of education. Most villages in India lack schools, much less devices to support quality education. 

<h3> Our Solution: AR/VR Technology </h3>


* We propose using AR/VR technology to create immersive educational experiences that are relevant and tailored With AR/VR technology, students can interact with digital models of animal cells, the human body like dermis, spine , membrane , DNA and more, Some models are of mechanics  making education more hands-on and engaging.

* AR/VR technology can also provide real-time feedback to students, helping them to understand complex concepts and track their progress more effectively.

<h3>What it does</h3>

AR/VR education offers several benefits over traditional education, including:

* Personalized learning experiences that cater to each student's unique needs and interests.
* Hands-on, interactive and immersive learning that makes education more engaging and fun.
* Easily accesible from phones, it is making education more widespread
* Quality education, anywhere, anytime


<h3>How we built it</h3>

Our system was based on the augmented reality display, using Unity to build the experience. For the imaging components, we used 3d Modeling software , Blender ,Animation .
